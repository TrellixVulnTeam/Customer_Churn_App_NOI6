Customer-Churn-Prediction
This is a mini-project for my Data Mining Class (18CSE355T). In this project , customer credit card data was used and customer churn was predicted.

The data included features like Credit Score , Age , Gender , Tenure , Balance and Estimated Salary etc.

After EDA of the data , LabelEncoder was used to encode Gender and other categorical data.

Finally , this data was used to train Decision Tree Model and Random Forest Model.

The random forest model was effective in it's prediction than Decision Tree with slightly better F1 score.
